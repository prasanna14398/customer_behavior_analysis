# customer_behavior_analysis
data analysis project showcasing customer behavior analysis using python,sql,powerbi
📊 Data Analysis & Business Intelligence Project
📌 Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end Data Analysis workflow — from raw dataset loading to interactive dashboard creation and final reporting.

The objective of this project is to:

Load and explore data using Python

Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Clean and preprocess the dataset

Execute SQL queries using ODBC (MySQL / SQL Server)

Build an interactive Power BI dashboard

Generate a structured analytical report

Create a presentation using Gamma

This project showcases practical skills in data cleaning, SQL querying, visualization, and business reporting.

📂 Dataset

Structured dataset (CSV / Database table)

Contains business-related structured data

Includes numerical and categorical features

Used for deriving insights and business recommendations

🛠 Tools & Technologies Used

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

SQL (MySQL / SQL Server)
